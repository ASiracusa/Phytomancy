# Phytomancy

This is a game development project I started working on since near the end of my junior year of high school. I sadly haven't worked on it too much over the summer yet, but I'm working on it now to hopefully get a few more features implemented and to up the graphics as much as I can.

9/25/2020 - I've been able to get a few more features added, but due to school ramping up again, I haven't been able to work on it as much as I would like. Hopefully I can find more regularity for it this October.
