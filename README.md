This is a game development project I started working on since near the end of my junior year of high school. I sadly haven't worked on it too much over the summer yet, but I'm working on it now to hopefully get a few more features implemented and to up the graphics as much as I can.

I've been able to get a few more features added, but due to school ramping up again, I haven't been able to work on it as much as I would like. Hopefully I can find more regularity for it this October.

Surprise! That didn't happen. Sadly, this project while stay on the back burner for a little while longer. I currently have a few projects running right now, so once those start to ease up, I can begin working on this again. It also doesn't help that I left my code in a somewhat broken state back in September, so casually starting it up again is out of the question.
